**LangChain Models**
This repository provides a flexible framework to work with a variety of language models using the LangChain ecosystem. Whether you're working on chatbots, intelligent agents, or custom LLM pipelines, LangChain enables seamless integration with both open-source and proprietary language models.

**Supported Model Types:**
it supports both closed-source and open-source language models:

**--->Closed-Source Models**
These include APIs from major providers such as:

OpenAI

Anthropic (Claude)

Google Gemini (formerly Bard)

These models typically offer cutting-edge performance and are hosted in the cloud. They require API keys and may have usage costs depending on the provider.

**--->Open-Source Models**
These are models you can run locally or on your own infrastructure, typically downloaded from platforms like Hugging Face. Examples include:

LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon, OpenChat, and more.

Open-source models offer greater flexibility and control but may require more setup and compute resources.

Note: The choice between open and closed models depends on your use case—whether you prioritize data privacy, customization, performance, or ease of use.

**⚠️ Before You Begin**
Before downloading any models or running the code, make sure to install the necessary dependencies by reviewing the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Some models may require additional packages, GPU support, or specific environment configurations, especially for local deployment
